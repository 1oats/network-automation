# Part I: VLAN Deployment Automation Solution

A.  Verify the industry-standard Python libraries that will be used to automate the deployment of VLANs by running a pip list. Provide a clear screenshot or exported text file with a full view of the screen, including the date and time, that verifies the libraries you will be using are installed. 

B.  Create an inventory that includes the configuration settings from the “General settings” and “Network” tabs on the device configuration screen for each of the switches that are in Access Closet 1 in the N-CoreA-01 (10.10.1.1) network. Provide documentation of the inventory as an exported text file or as clear screenshots with a full view of the screen, including the date and time. 

C.  Configure the VLAN infrastructure and set up continuous integration by doing the following:

1.  Write a Python script that identifies existing VLANs within Access Closet 1 on the 10.10.1.1 network.
2.  Write a Python script that adds and configures the VLAN infrastructure to align with the needs described in the given scenario.
3.  Verify the VLAN infrastructure is configured properly by documenting the successful execution of your script via a clear exported text file or screenshot with a full view of the screen, including the date and time.
4.  Integrate code within a private Git repository for continuous integration and deployment of the script. Document your integration by providing the URL of your Git repository and a screenshot of the Git repository.

D.  Describe the process you used to complete your VLAN deployment, including each of the following in your description:

- a list of the industry-standard tools used
- the outputs
- the inventory
- the validation, testing, and troubleshooting steps completed throughout the process
