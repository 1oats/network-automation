# Part II: User Account Automation

E.  Verify the industry-standard tools that will be used to automate user accounts by running a pip list.

F.  Create an inventory file that includes the configuration settings from the “General settings” and “Network” tabs on the device configuration screen for each Windows desktop and each of the test boxes that are in Access Closet 1 in the N-CoreA-01 (10.10.1.1) network. Provide a copy of your inventory file as an exported text file or as clear screenshots.

G.  Use Ansible to automate the creation of local user accounts on each of the following devices in Access Closet 1: the switches, the four Windows desktops, and the test boxes on the account and management networks. Your automation solution for user accounts on each device must include the following:

- user names, passwords, and access levels as defined in the “Network Automation Scenario” attachment<br>
- Ansible playbook integration<br>
- documentation of your successfully run code in a private Git repository via an exported text file, a URL of your Git repository, and a screenshot of the Git repository.


H.  Describe the process you used to complete the automation of user accounts and include each of the following in your description:

- a list of the industry-standard tools used<br>
- the outputs<br>
- the inventory<br>
- the validation, testing, and troubleshooting steps completed throughout the process.
